I'm moving this package to a literate programming format to make it easier to maintain.

Source blocks are tangled using org-babel.

* STARTED Canvas API Docs & docs for some of the packages used.   
- The very extensive Canvas REST API is [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/][documented in full here]].
- Most institutions also provide a [[[ df [[ [[https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-14390-canvas-apis-getting-started-the-practical-ins-and-outs-gotchas-tips-and-tricks  [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/live][live API]], as [[https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-14390-canvas-apis-getting-started-the-practical-ins-and-outs-gotchas-tips-and-tricks][discussed in this excellent and somewhat hidden document]]. You'll need to use your own institution's instance since you need an auth token; I use [[https://q.utoronto.ca/doc/api/live#!/][the one that University of Toronto provides]]
- The [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.graphql.html][GraphQL API]] is much less well-documented, though it also comes with a live interaction tool; at U of T it's [[https://q.utoronto.ca/graphiql][at this URL]]. 
- Add some docs about request, and maybe dash? 
* Package intro

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;; org-lms -- Summary
  ;;;
  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; Library to facilitate marking assignments and interacting
  ;;; with the Canvas LMS (https://canvas.instructure.com/) via its
  ;;; JSON API (https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/).
  ;;;
  ;;; Functionality is still rough and design is idiosyncratic. I hope to
  ;;; one day design a more robusti nterface but... who know?

* STARTED Variable definitions
The underlying data structure has changed a bit :-) as I start to understand what information needs to be stored in non-textual data structures and what doesn't. A lot of this has not been documented yet!
  
- need to give a better default value to org-lms-courses

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* NEEDSHELP Set up Testing
Thisi s a complete joke; needs to be entirely rethought. 

Unit tests wil lbe defined throughout and just tangled to a different place! First we have to set up the environment. You'll need to set some of these values up yourself!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle org-lms-tests.el
  (setq-local default-assignments (org-lms-read-assignment-map
                                   "~/Wildwater/Assignments-ww1.org")
        default-courseid 64706
        default-students (org-lms-merge-student-lists))
#+end_src

* Helper functions
These functions do things like parse csv files, set up json properly, etc.  
** ACTION Debug Messages
I am unfortunately no past the stage of using debug messages :-/
sooo.. write this fing function?  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(debug-message (message )
(if plaplapla))
#+end_src
** ACTION Read global values of org file
Stolen from [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/21713/how-to-get-property-values-from-org-file-headers/21715#21715][stackexchange]] via [[https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org#publishing-to-leanpub][Diego Zamboni]], thee functions allow Emacs to see values of props set in the header. 

I need to figure out a setter -- these are just getters.  Something like :

~(insert (concat "#+" (upcase property )))~

*EDIT <2019-09-19 Thu>:* Actually I have my keyword getter  from John Kitchin somewhere; that does a better job. In either case I should make sure that the buffer gets widened inside the function so that everything can be set properly.  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-lms-global-props (&optional property buffer)
    "Get the plists of global org properties of current buffer."
    (unless property (setq property "PROPERTY"))
    (with-current-buffer (or buffer (current-buffer))
      (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'keyword (lambda (el) (when (string-match property (org-element-property :key el)) el)))))

  (defun org-lms-global-prop-value (key)
    "Get global org property KEY of current buffer."
    (org-element-property :value (car (org-lms-global-props key))))
#+end_src

** JSON helpers and wrappers
Intended to make it easier to read and write json according to the library's standards.
- ol-jsonwrapper :: macro to set ~json.el~ vars temporarily around a ~json-read~ call
- ol-write-json-plists :: either there's a bug or I'm not understanding something; without thissetting lists of plists were being interpreted wrong by json-encode.
-  ::

Much of the code in this library reads and sets properties at the headline level.  These helpers should increase readability and maintainability.

* Talking to Canvas - Fundamentals
Everything in here should be generically useful, and segregated from my unique workflow. That means, among other things, that there should be a specific relationship to an API endpoint. 
** Doc: Functions to interact with specific parts of the Canvas API
This is a lot of the bulk of the library; these convenience functions make it easier to ask Canvas for specific, requently-requested kinds of information.

Organization:
- GETTERS :: for each supported endpoint, write a simple convenience function using ~org-lms-canvas-request~ to GET json data from endpoint
- SETTERS :: for each supported endpoint, write a simple convenience function using ~org=lms-canvas-request~ to POST or PUT json data to endpoint
- TRANSFORMERS :: where appropriate, write additional functions to translate canvas data into a form compatible with local data  

 Supported Endpoints

:END:
These are basically wrappers around ~request.el~ that allow some of the requests to be simplified. I have written 2 functions, one for passing requests via header arguments, and another for passing them via json. THese should be combined & I should use a switch to allow users to use one interface rather than theo ther (though probably we should always go through the JSON interface!

** ACTION [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/files.html#method.folders.api_index][Files and Folders]]
I now want this so I can store HTML files easily and then add to modules (again, easily)

Some of this is rather more complex because of the way folders are conceptualized in Canvas. Might not be trivial to implement. [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/files.html#method.folders.api_index][cf. api info]]

- [ ] org-lms-get-folders (list all oflders, or list folders in a folder
- [ ] org-lms-get-files (list all files)
- [ ] org-lms-get-single-file
- [ ] org-lms-set-folder
- [ ] org-lms-set-file
- [ ] org-lms-set-file-from-attachment ? 
*** Getters

Start with folders, which are simple and very similar to modules in that they ave simple content items. Files, however, [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.file_uploads.html#method.file_uploads.post][are much more complex]], because they are stored off site (mostly AWS) and therefore require a multi-stage process. This was previously implemented in org-lms-get-submissions, now generalizing in order to keep code DRYer.

[[https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10735][modules]] are collections of content intended to structure a course into sections ([[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/modules.html][see api docs]]).  They don't map all that well onto my course docs organization, and they're likely to be difficult to maintain.  It wil ltake a lot of work to do this properly, but probably want to start with 
- [ ] an *accessor* that downloads module(s) using the [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/modules.html#method.context_modules_api.index][list modules]] function, and iterate through the results to create a tree with module item attributes stored in subtree properties.
- [ ] a *translator* that captures the lms item at point and stores its attributes in an org-element object that can be pasted into an existing module.  

The UI for this is likely to be a bit finicky so maybe don't make a lot of decisions right now.

We don't plan to support all the module options for now

I don't believe these are working! Need to get it done so that can be added as a hook to the end of other setters. 

Here are the module possibilities

module[unlock_at] 		DateTime 	
module[position] 		integer 	
module[require_sequential_progress] 		boolean

** ACTION Calendar Events
Right now I have no way to generate calendar events & therefore put stuff into the "upcoming events' stream in Canvas.  [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/calendar_events.html][The API for Calendar Events is described here]]. It won't be easy for me to accommodate this mode of organization, unfortunately.  Probably won't happen for a while.

Here is some info form the web:


**** [[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/calendar_events.html#method.calendar_events_api.set_course_timetable][Set a course timetable]] [[https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/blob/master/app/controllers/calendar_events_api_controller.rb][CalendarEventsApiController#set_course_timetable]]
   
***** POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/calendar_events/timetable
 *Scope:* =url:POST|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/calendar_events/timetable=

Creates and updates “timetable” events for a course. Can automaticaly generate a series of calendar events based on simple schedules (e.g. “Monday and Wednesday at 2:00pm” )

Existing timetable events for the course and course sections will be updated if they still are part of the timetable. Otherwise, they will be deleted.

****** Request Parameters:
timetables[course_section_id][] 		Array 	

An array of timetable objects for the course section specified by course_section_id. If course_section_id is set to “all”, events will be created for the entire course.
timetables[course_section_id][][weekdays] 		string 	

A comma-separated list of abbreviated weekdays (Mon-Monday, Tue-Tuesday, Wed-Wednesday, Thu-Thursday, Fri-Friday, Sat-Saturday, Sun-Sunday)
timetables[course_section_id][][start_time] 		string 	

Time to start each event at (e.g. “9:00 am”)
timetables[course_section_id][][end_time] 		string 	

Time to end each event at (e.g. “9:00 am”)
timetables[course_section_id][][location_name] 		string 	

A location name to set for each event

**** Integration with Mail systems
I like to mail my marks back to my students.  These are the functions that manage that.  

***** Attachments 

Make sure to get all the attachments.  I think that org-mime now takes care of this so it might be a good idea to refactor.

***** ACTION Sending Subtrees
Huh, interesting. I have two versions of this code and no idea which of them is actually used where!! +In fact, it kind of looks like neither is being used.  Source of much confusion!!+

*UPDATE <2018-11-08 Thu>:* ~org-mime-lms-send-subtree-with-attachments~ is an obsolete function which has been replaced by ~org-lms-mime-org-subtree-htmlize~.  I'm too chicken to delete it right now but should do so soon.

*UPDATE <2019-10-01 Tue>:* need to remove calls to ~mwp-org-get-parent-headline~, and also figure out if these are still used at all.

Thisi s copied from ox-huveal, which in turn is copied from ox-hugo.  Disabling async b/c that would likely fuck things up since I need the file for the transfer.  Would be nice to have a non-blocking way to do this.

Also need to remove the ox-hugo dependencies.

This is an Export \"What I Mean\" function:

- If the current subtree has the \"EXPORT_FILE_NAME\" property, export
  that subtree.
- If the current subtree doesn't have that property, but one of its
  parent subtrees has, then export from that subtree's scope.
- If none of the subtrees have that property (or if there are no Org
  subtrees at all), but the Org #+title keyword is present,
  export the whole Org file as a post with that title (calls
  `org-huveal-export-to-html' with its SUBTREEP argument set to nil).

- If ALL-SUBTREES is non-nil, export all valid Hugo post subtrees
  \(that have the \"EXPORT_FILE_NAME\" property) in the current file
  to multiple Markdown posts.
- If ALL-SUBTREES is non-nil, and again if none of the subtrees have
  that property (or if there are no Org subtrees), but the Org #+title
  keyword is present, export the whole Org file.

- If the file neither has valid Hugo post subtrees, nor has the
  ,#+title present, throw a user error.  If NOERROR is non-nil, use
  `message' to display the error message instead of signaling a user
  error.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting file should be accessible through
the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

If ALL-SUBTREES is nil, return output file's name.
If ALL-SUBTREES is non-nil, and valid subtrees are found, return
a list of output files.
If ALL-SUBTREES is non-nil, and valid subtrees are not found,
return the output file's name (exported using file-based
approach)."
