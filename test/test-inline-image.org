** Plain Inline Image

** Float Right

#+ATTR_HTML: :class float-right
[[file:20100310_95.JPG]]

Text wrapping to the left of a float-right image. The image should appear
flush right with this paragraph text flowing around its left side. Canvas
preserves the =float: right= style inlined by juice from the =.figure.float-right=
CSS rule in =canvas-styles.css=.

** Float Left

#+ATTR_HTML: :class float-left
[[file:20100310_95.JPG]]

Text wrapping to the right of a float-left image. The image should appear
flush left with this paragraph text flowing around its right side. Canvas
preserves the =float: left= style inlined by juice from the =.figure.float-left=
CSS rule in =canvas-styles.css=.

** Two Columns — Text Left, Image Right

#+BEGIN_canvas-2col
#+BEGIN_canvas-col
Weekly content, readings, links, and other text go here. This column takes
up approximately half the available width. The image is shown to the right.
#+END_canvas-col
#+BEGIN_canvas-col
[[file:20100310_95.JPG]]
#+END_canvas-col
#+END_canvas-2col

** Two Columns — Image Left, Text Right

#+BEGIN_canvas-2col
#+BEGIN_canvas-col
[[file:20100310_95.JPG]]
#+END_canvas-col
#+BEGIN_canvas-col
Content on the right side of the layout. The image occupies the left column
and this text occupies the right column. Both columns have equal width.
#+END_canvas-col
#+END_canvas-2col

** Two Columns — Wide (Text) + Narrow (Image)

#+BEGIN_canvas-2col
#+BEGIN_canvas-col-wide
Wide column (~2/3): main content, narrative text, or an extended reading list
goes here. This is the =canvas-col-wide= class with =flex: 2 1 55%=.
#+END_canvas-col-wide
#+BEGIN_canvas-col-narrow
[[file:20100310_95.JPG]]
#+END_canvas-col-narrow
#+END_canvas-2col

** Two Columns — Narrow (Image) + Wide (Text)

#+BEGIN_canvas-2col
#+BEGIN_canvas-col-narrow
[[file:20100310_95.JPG]]
#+END_canvas-col-narrow
#+BEGIN_canvas-col-wide
Wide column (~2/3) on the right: main content goes here. The narrow image
column is on the left. This is the =canvas-col-narrow= + =canvas-col-wide=
combination with the image preceding the text.
#+END_canvas-col-wide
#+END_canvas-2col
